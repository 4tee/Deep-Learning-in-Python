# The relationship between forward and backward propagation #

If you have gone through 4 iterations of calculating slopes (using backward propagation) and then updated weights, how many times must you have done forward propagation?

## Answer: 4 ##

> Each time you generate predictions using forward propagation, you update the weights using backward propagation.
